============

Odd snippets of LaTeX code, collected in one place so I don't need to keep remembering in which file I was when I last mastered some trickery

indep.tex symbol for statistical independence 

beamer-footer.tex insert a bit of text bottom right of a beamer slide

shadequote.tex insert some text inbetween oversized quotation symbols
