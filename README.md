# random-latex

Odd snippets of LaTeX code, collected in one place so I don't need to
keep remembering in which file I was when I last mastered some
trickery

-   br.tex put text at bottom right of slide

-   oset.tex better overset

-   splitcircle.tex splitcircle node in tikz

-   indep.tex symbol for statistical independence

-   beamer-footer.tex insert a bit of text bottom right of a beamer slide

-   shadequote.tex insert some text inbetween oversized quotation symbols

-   mybeamer.tex how I like my beamer

-   ticks.tex a tick symbol
